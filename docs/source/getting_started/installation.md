# Installation

```{eval-rst}
.. meta::
   :description: This page contains the installation instructions for Orchest.
```

This page contains the installation instructions for self-hosting the open source version of Orchest.

The easiest way to use Orchest is through our free [hosted version](https://cloud.orchest.io/signup). Get up and running with a fully configured Orchest instance in less than 2 minutes.

```{note}
Orchest is in beta.
```

## Prerequisites

To install Orchest you will need a running [Kubernetes (k8s) cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/). You can either pick a managed
service by one of the certified [cloud platforms](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/turnkey-solutions/) or create a cluster
yourself. For single node deployments, we recommend using at (the very) least 2 CPU and 8GB of RAM
(see {ref}`CPU contention <cpu-contention-dns>`).
Do note that only the following container runtimes are supported:

- [containerd](https://containerd.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime/)

Pick your deployment environment and Kubernetes distribution and follow the installation steps
below. In case you have custom requirements, be sure to first check out the
{ref}`custom requirements <custom-install-requirements>` section.

(regular-installation)=

## Installing Orchest

We recommend installing Orchest on a clean cluster to prevent clashes with existing cluster-level resources,
even though installing Orchest on an existing cluster is fully supported.
At this time we only support running Orchest on Linux (`x86_64`). Either through `minikube` on a Linux bare-metal/VM or on a Kubernetes cluster.

```

## Managing your Orchest installation

Your Orchest installation can be fully managed through the `orchest-cli`, check out the available
commands in the {ref}`Orchest CLI reference <cli-reference>`.

```{note}
Your Kubernetes cluster has to be up in order for the `orchest-cli` to be able to interact with it.
```

(custom-install-requirements)=

## Custom requirements

If you have **custom requirements** (or preferences) for deploying Orchest on your Kubernetes
cluster, then one of the following subsections might be helpful:

- {ref}`Setting up an FQDN <install-fqdn>`: Reach Orchest using a Fully Qualified Domain Name
  (FQDN) instead of the cluster's IP directly.
- {ref}`Installing without Argo Workflows <install-argo>`: Don't let Orchest manage Argo in case you
  already have Argo Workflows installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
- {ref}`Installing without Nginx Ingress Controller <install-nginx>`: Don't let Orchest manage
  nginx ingress controller if you already have it installed on your Kubernetes cluster.
- {ref}`Installing using kubectl <install-kubectl>`: If you would rather use `kubectl` instead of
  the `orchest-cli`.
- {ref}`Setting up a reverse proxy <reverse-proxy>`: Useful when installing Orchest in remote machines,
  such as AWS EC2 instances.
- {ref}`Scarse (CPU) resources - tweak DNS settings <cpu-contention-dns>`: Increase DNS query
  timeout to prevent name resolution failing during time of CPU resource contention. Especially
  applicable for single node deployments close to the minimum requirement of 2 vCPU.

(install-fqdn)=

### Setting up an FQDN

If you would rather reach Orchest using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), e.g. by simply going
to `http://localorchest.io` in your browser, instead of using the cluster's IP directly, you can
install Orchest using:

```bash
orchest install --fqdn="localorchest.io"
```

% or, if you have already installed Orchest but would like to set up an FQDN

For local Kubernetes clusters such as minikube, you can now make Orchest reachable through the
FQDN by:

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Linux
```bash
# Set up the default Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in your
# /etc/hosts so that you can reach Orchest locally.
echo "$(minikube ip)\tlocalorchest.io" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
````
````{tab-item} macOS
```bash
# Set up the default Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in your
# /etc/hosts so that you can reach Orchest locally.
echo "127.0.0.1\tlocalorchest.io" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

And don't forget to also run `sudo minikube tunnel`.
````
`````

(install-argo)=

### Installing Orchest without Argo Workflows

If you already have [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) installed globally
(i.e. not namespaced) on your Kubernetes cluster, then you need to explicitly tell Orchest not to
install it again:

```bash
orchest install --no-argo
```

Since Argo Workflows creates cluster level resources, installing it again would lead to clashes or
both Argo Workflow deployments managing Custom Resource Objects (most likely you don't want either
of those things to happen).

Now that you are using an Argo Workflows set-up that is not managed by the Orchest Controller, you
need to make sure that the right set of permissions are configured for Orchest to work as expected.
Check out the permissions that the Orchest Controller sets for Argo
[here](https://github.com/orchest/orchest/tree/v2022.08.8/services/orchest-controller/deploy/thirdparty/argo-workflows).
In addition, Orchest makes use of Argo's [`Container Set`](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/container-set-template/) in a single-node setting
(i.e. you have `singleNode: true` in the `OrchestCluster` CR Object) which requires the use of the
[`Emissary Executor`](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/workflow-executors/#emissary-emissary).

(install-nginx)=

### Installing Orchest without Nginx Ingress Controller

If you already have [nginx ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy) deployed on your
Kubernetes cluster, then you need to tell Orchest not to install it again:

```bash
orchest install --no-nginx
```

```{note}
Installation of the `Nginx Ingress Controller` requires different procedures on [EKS](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#aws)
and [GKE](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke) clusters.
```

(install-kubectl)=

### Installing Orchest using `kubectl`

The code snippet below will install Orchest in the `orchest` namespace. In case you want to
install in another namespace you can use tools like [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) to
change the specified namespace in `orchest-controller.yaml` and `example-orchestcluster.yaml`.

```bash
# Get the latest available Orchest version
export VERSION=$(curl \
   "https://update-info.orchest.io/api/orchest/update-info/v3?version=None&is_cloud=False" \
   | grep -oP "v\d+\.\d+\.\d+")

# Create the namespace to install Orchest in
kubectl create ns orchest

# Deploy the Orchest Operator
kubectl apply \
  -f "https://github.com/orchest/orchest/releases/download/${VERSION}/orchest-controller.yaml"

# Apply an OrchestCluster Custom Resource
# NOTE: You can also first download the example manifest so that you
# can tweak it to your liking. For example, preventing Orchest from
# also deploying the Nginx controller (because you have already
# configured ingress on your cluster) through the
# `controller.orchest.io/deploy-ingress` annotation.
kubectl apply \
  -f "https://github.com/orchest/orchest/releases/download/${VERSION}/example-orchestcluster.yaml"
```

In case you want to configure the Orchest Cluster, you can patch the created `OrchestCluster`.

(reverse-proxy)=

### Setting up a reverse proxy

When installing Orchest in remote machines, such as AWS EC2 instances,
you will need to set up a reverse proxy that redirects traffic to the application appropriately.
Here is an example on how to do it on an Ubuntu-based EC2 machine using [nginx]:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nginx

# Make Orchest accessible on the instance through localorchest.io
minikube ip | xargs printf "%s localorchest.io" | sudo tee -a  /etc/hosts

# Set up a reverse proxy that listens on port 80 of the host
# and routes traffic to Orchest
sudo cat << EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-available/localorchest.io
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name orchest;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localorchest.io;

        # For project or file manager uploads.
        client_max_body_size 0;

        # WebSocket support.
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }
}
EOF

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/localorchest.io /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# Remove default_server.
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
sudo service nginx restart
```

(cpu-contention-dns)=

### Scarse (CPU) resources - tweak DNS settings

This section applies mostly to single-node deployments as otherwise you can configure your
Kubernetes cluster to scale with respect to the current load or separate your control plane nodes
from your worker nodes.

During times of CPU resource contention, the [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) pod could start failing
its `readinessProbe` leading to `kube-proxy` updating `iptables` rules to stop routing traffic to
the pod ([k8s
docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#types-of-probe)), for which
it uses the `REJECT` target. This means that DNS queries will start failing immediately without the
configured resolver timeout being respected (in Orchest we use a timeout of `10` seconds with `5`
attempts). In order to respect the timeout instead of failing immediately, you can tweak the
`readinessProbe` or simply remove it by editing the manifest of the `coredns` deployment:

```sh
kubectl edit -n kube-system deploy coredns
```

```{note}
ð For Minikube users we automatically take care of this. Even the warning below doesn't apply.
```

```{warning}
Configuration changes of CoreDNS will be lost when executing `kubeadm upgrade apply` -- see [Kubernetes
docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-reconfigure/#applying-coredns-configuration-changes).
Thus you will have to reapply your changes whenever you run `kubeadm upgrade apply`.

Why? Well, the [CoreDNS manifests are hardcoded in
`kubeadm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4daf5f903b3cb73365093e2f83c18d4d8e53c0c5/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/addons/dns/manifests.go),
thus if `kubeadm init phase addon coredns` is ever invoked, then your changes to the configuration
of CoreDNS are lost.

What can I do about it? If you are using `kubeadm` directly, then you could skip the `kubeadm` addon
phase and deploy the respective addons yourself. Or you could just reapply your CoreDNS manifest
changes each time.
```
