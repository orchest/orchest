Orchest is not here to reinvent the wheel when it comes to your favorite editor, Orchest is a web
based platform that works on top of your filesystem (similar to JupyterLab) allowing you to use your
editor of choice. With Orchest you get to focus on visually building and iterating on your
pipelining ideas.

Orchest lets you
* Interactively build pipelines in our visual interface.
* Develop your code in your favorite editor. Everything is filesystem based.
* Pick what cells you want to skip when executing a notebook. Perfect for prototyping as you do not 
  have to maintain a perfectly clean notebook.
