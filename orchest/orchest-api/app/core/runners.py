    A partial run is described by the pipeline description, selection of
    step UUIDs and a run type. The call-order of the steps is always
    preserved, e.g. a --> b then a will always be run before b.

    Type of runs:
        * Run all the steps of the pipeline.
        * Given a selection of UUIDs run only the selection.
        * Given a selection of UUIDs, run all their proper ancestors (i.e.
          parents in a directed graph). This can be done either inclusive
          or exclusive of the selection (making it run all ancestors
          instead of proper ancestors - thus including the step itself).

    NOTE:
        Running a pipeline fully can also be described as a partial run.

        uuids: a selection/sequence of pipeline step UUIDs. If `run_type`
